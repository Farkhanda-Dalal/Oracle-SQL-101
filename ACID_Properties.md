## 💥 ACID Properties in DBMS

**Definition (1-liner to start your answer):**

> ACID stands for **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability** — these are the key properties that ensure a transaction in a database is reliable, even in case of failures.

---

### 🧩 1️⃣ **Atomicity — “All or Nothing”**

**Meaning:**
A transaction is *atomic* — it either completes fully or doesn’t happen at all.

**Example:**
When transferring ₹1000 from Account A to B:

* Step 1: Deduct ₹1000 from A
* Step 2: Add ₹1000 to B

If Step 2 fails, Step 1 must *roll back* so money doesn’t disappear.

**Interview tip:**
✅ “Atomicity ensures that partial transactions don’t leave the database in an inconsistent state.”

---

### ⚖️ 2️⃣ **Consistency — “Valid before and after”**

**Meaning:**
The database must remain *valid* before and after the transaction.
All constraints, rules, and relationships must still hold true.

**Example:**
If a constraint says account balance cannot go negative, the DB should reject any transaction violating this.

**Interview tip:**
✅ “Consistency ensures that only valid data following all constraints is written to the database.”

---

### 🔒 3️⃣ **Isolation — “No interference between transactions”**

**Meaning:**
Multiple transactions can occur at the same time without affecting each other’s results.

**Example:**
Two users booking movie tickets — each transaction should see a *consistent* view of the seats and not double-book.

**Interview tip:**
✅ “Isolation prevents one transaction’s intermediate data from being visible to another.”

*(If interviewer asks further:)*

* SQL supports isolation levels like **READ UNCOMMITTED**, **READ COMMITTED**, **REPEATABLE READ**, **SERIALIZABLE**.

### 💾 4️⃣ **Durability — “Once done, it stays done”**

**Meaning:**
After a transaction is successfully committed, its changes are *permanent* — even if the system crashes immediately after.

**Example:**
If a transfer succeeds and then the server crashes, the new balance should still be there when it restarts.

**Interview tip:**
✅ “Durability guarantees that committed data is safely stored on disk and cannot be lost.”

| Property        | Keyword        | Meaning                              |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Atomicity**   | All or nothing | Entire transaction succeeds or fails |
| **Consistency** | Validity       | Database remains correct             |
| **Isolation**   | Independence   | Transactions don’t affect each other |
| **Durability**  | Permanence     | Committed data won’t be lost         |

## 💬 How to Say It in an Interview (sample answer)

> “ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
> Atomicity ensures a transaction happens completely or not at all.
> Consistency maintains database validity before and after a transaction.
> Isolation ensures transactions running simultaneously don’t affect each other’s results.
> And Durability means once a transaction is committed, the data remains safe even after system failures.
> Together, these properties make database transactions reliable.”
